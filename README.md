# Password-Generator-
Homework 3
This application is made to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters using arrays and functions. 

While I understand the concept of behind Java the syntax somewhat escapes my view. While working through this I was able to get the basic layer of Java on the page through arrays and the function, I was not able to get it to run correctly. so this reqwuires improvment.
